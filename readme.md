# BurnyGames Playable Developer Test Task

## Playable Ads Developer - Test Task

### Welcome!

We invite you to complete this test task. The task consists of developing a playable ad. A sample video animation is included in the provided archive.

### Art Assets:
- Background
- Shape figure "pancake"
- 6 figures near the shape
- Red glow effect for errors
- Cursor
- Final screen with a button
- Additional assets: cube, field (if needed for custom slicing or other ideas)
- Sounds
- Panel for displaying text from the video
- Font

### Task Details
You need to create a playable ad for **Applovin**, where the player places figures into the given shape. Figures snap to the grid when placed within the shape. Each figure can be positioned anywhere on the field unless obstructed by other figures or the shape's contour.

- If the player fails to complete the shape correctly (i.e., placing figures incorrectly, preventing all pieces from fitting), the field highlights in **red**, the figures **reset to their initial positions**, and a **“Try Again”** message appears.
- If the player correctly completes the shape, a **“Well Done”** message (can be simple text) appears, followed by the **final screen with a button**.
- Animations and visual effects should match those shown in the provided video.
- Clicking the final button should redirect to the specified link.

### Technical Requirements
The playable ad must comply with **Applovin’s** guidelines:
- [Applovin Best Practices & Guidelines](https://support.applovin.com/hc/en-us/articles/228046827-Best-Practices-Guidelines)
- You can **test your playable** here: [Applovin Playable Preview](https://p.applov.in/playablePreview?create=1&qr=1)

### Deliverables
The final submission should include:
- **GitHub repository** with:
  - `README.md` (this file)
  - **Source files**
  - The final playable ad **exported for Applovin**

If you are unable to complete the full task due to time constraints, please describe what was completed and demonstrate the aspects that best showcase your playable ad development skills.

Good luck!
